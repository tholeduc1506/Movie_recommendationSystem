Content-based filtering is one popular technique of recommendation or recommender systems. The content or attributes of the things you like are referred to as "content." 

Here, the system uses your features and likes in order to recommend you with things that you might like. It uses the information provided by you over the internet and the ones they are able to gather and then they curate recommendations according to that.  

The goal behind content-based filtering is to classify products with specific keywords, learn what the customer likes, look up those terms in the database, and then recommend similar things.

This type of recommender system is hugely dependent on the inputs provided by users, some common examples included Google, Wikipedia, etc. For example, when a user searches for a group of keywords, then Google displays all the items consisting of those keywords.
